Similar to lost ethr, the bonuscap was set to 0.0031337 ETH so I called depositwithbonus() and sent 0.004 ETH, exceeding the bonus cap.
Due to the broken modifier, the function skipped the refund and accepted my ETH anyway.
No tokens were minted, and totaleth did not increase â€” but the contract balance increased.
