The winner is determined by the XOR of blockhash(gamestart) and blockhash(gameend). The outcome of the game can be influenced by carefully timing extend() to shift gameend into a block that favors a win. I joined the game by calling deposit(), then waited for the house to deposit and start the game. I then monitored the block number and only called resolve() once the game ended and the winning condition was met.
