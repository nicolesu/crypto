Minimum d for collision probability < 50%: 16
Answer computed using the below function:

***
def ComputeDoubleSignature():
    target_prob = 0.5
    n = 200  
    # just a starting point
    d = 1
    while (n ** 2) / (2 ** (d + 1)) >= target_prob:
        d += 1
        
    with open("double.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write(f"Minimum d for collision probability < 50%: {d}\n")
