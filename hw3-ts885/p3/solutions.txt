To deanonymize the transactions, I used Blockchain.com to analyze the total amount of BTC each input and output address received. By comparing the “Total received” values, I looked for matches where an output address received an amount slightly less than one of the input addresses—accounting for a small, randomized mixing fee. Using the relationship output = input – fee, I was able to identify which output address corresponded to each input, effectively deanonymizing the transactions.
